JavaKinbote
===========

This program is an example of how to call the Kinbote Annotator from Java.

It depends on the [Kinbote 1.0.0](https://github.com/wpm/Kinbote/releases/tag/1.0.0) package.
You can build the JAR and .pom file with `sbt publish-local` then install them to your [local Maven respository](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html).
